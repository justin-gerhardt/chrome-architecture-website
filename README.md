[Installation instructions](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/)

Development
-----------

When you are ready to start developing run `hugo serve`.

 You can than access a local copy of the website at http://localhost:1313 . If you make any changes the server will automatically rebuild the site and refresh your browser (as long as you haven't broken the html). 

 Deploy
 ----------
 
 Commits to this repo are automatically build by [travis](https://travis-ci.com/justin-gerhardt/chrome-architecture-website) and deployed to aws.

 This process should take ~2 minutes.
